# No Place Like ~

A solid collection of dotfiles primarily focused around configuring the `AwesomeWM` but has useful other things

## Support For

- **AwesomeWM:** An *awesome* window manager
- **Polybar:** A highly customizable navigation bar
- **Rofi:** Cool application launcher
- **Dunst:** Notification system
- **Alacritty:** Terminal emulator
- **Tmux:** Terminal multiplexer
- **Zsh:** Customizable shell (bash alternative)
- **Neovim:** Blazingly fast text editor
- **Zathura:** Document viewer

## Installation

All of these files are meant to be in the home directory

```
cd ~
git clone https:://github.com/JoshuaMarkle/dotfiles.git
```

This will create a `dotfiles` directory inside of `~`. Now, just move everything out into the home directory

```
cd dotfiles
mv * ~
```

And you're all set! Enjoy :)
